I am a freelance researcher, a programmer (librarian), and an audiophile.

# Researches
My research interest includes, but not exclusively, the following:
+ Foundations of Mathematics
+ Topology
+ Theoretical Computer Science
+ Mathematical Economics
+ Theories of Generalised Functions
+ Analysis of Electric and Acoustic Circuits
+ Philosophy of Mathematics
+ Philosophy of Law

I am writing comprehensive textbooks on mathematical sciences, including [the theory of computation](https://amntksr.booth.pm/items/1536898), [nonstandard analysis](https://amntksr.booth.pm/items/1536942) and [social choice theory](https://amntksr.booth.pm/items/1593809). One aim of my writing is to introduce lesser-known but interesting fields of mathematics and related areas.

# Programming
The following are main programming languages I have experienced:
+ C++
+ Scheme
+ Python

Since 2011, I have developed the C++ Template Library [RUIN](https://github.com/AmaneTsukishiro/Ruin) which is an etude for trying meta-programming and applying theoretical computer science. 

# Audio
As an audiophile, I have used many (although not so many compared with popular reviewers) headphones, DACs, HPAs, cables, eartips and earpads, and have reviewed some of them privately. For example, I have measured electromagnetic properties of headphone cables and theoretically analysed their acoustic properties. I have also an experience in making speakers, DACs and AMPs (both monolithic and discrete).
